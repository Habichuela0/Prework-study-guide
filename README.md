# Prework-study-guide

## Description

I built this website as a tool to help study for bootcamp. Creating the website taught me a lot about HTML, JS, CSS, ETC. This was a fun way for me to familiarize myself with these programming languages. Enjoy!


## Installation

Open the command line and cd into the prework-study-guide directory after downloading it. To begin coding and simply type Code .

## Usage

The website is pretty simple to use. To look at the different topics and receive a random topic for studying simply inspect and navigate to the console.



## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
